This is a starter project to learn how to code. You will build a Tic Tac Toe game which will evolve into a snake game


You will take the following steps for this assignment:

Assignment setup
- You will be working in the File TicTacToeView.swift
- There will be a folder called examples which will have examples on how to do everything you need to complete the game
- Each step will have an example foloder that should help you with that step

Steps
1. Get the simulator to run your app
2. Show a "start game" button in the GameView screen
3. When the button is pressed change the button to say "restart game"
4. Draw a box on the screen
5. Draw a X inside your box
6. Change the box to X / O / Empty when tapped
7. Make your box resusable
8. Build a row of 3 boxes - (Array fundamentals)
9. Build 3 rows of boxes
10. Build game logic
11. Polish game


Stretch goal - Conver Tic tac toe to snake
1. Create File called SnakeView.swift
2. Render a 20x20 box
3. Create a view model of arrays to represent your 20x20box
4. Create a timer to move the snake
5. Create logic
6. Polish game
