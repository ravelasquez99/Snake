#  Assignment 9

- Try to build the logic of whether there is a tic tac toe winner by calling "TicTocWinCalculator.studentCheckWinner()"
    - Ask Ricky how functions work
    - if you want to test your logic, write tests to see if your logic works
    - You can call "TicTocWinCalculator.studentCheckWinner()" from a test file you make and then run asserts on your logic to make sure it works
    - What to return:
        - return "X" if X won
        - return "O" if O won
        - return "" if no one won
        - return "invalid" if the game is invalid
    - If you get stuck and want the answe you can scroll to the bottom of he "WinnerCalculator" file to see the code
